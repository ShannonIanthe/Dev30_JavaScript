//assigning the variable myAge the value of my age
let myAge = 31;

//assigning the variable early years the value of 2
let earlyYears = 2;

earlyYears *= 10.5;

//laterYears is equal to the myAge variable minus two
let laterYears = myAge - 2;

//after the 2 years, then multiply by 4 
laterYears *= 4; 

//to obtain dog years I add the two variables together
myAgeInDogYears = earlyYears + laterYears;

//creating the myName variable and assigning it 'Shannon'
let myName = 'Shannon';

//using the string method to lowercase all the letters in my name

//Using a string interpolation to display the values of the variable in a sentence
console.log(`My name is ${myName}. I am ${myAge} years old in human years which is ${myAgeInDogYears} years old in dog years.`);
